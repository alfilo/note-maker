        <h1>Who I am</h1>
        <p>I'm a U1 student at McGill University and a (relatively) new arrival
            in Montréal.  I love learning and practicing languages (if you speak
            French and/or Spanish and want to have a chat I'd love that), and
            of course meeting new people and gaining new perspectives on the world.
            I have to admit that most of my time now is going towards studying and
            climbing, but I'm always looking for something fun to do to meet more
            people.  I'm an avid cook (recipes page coming soon, if there's any code
            geeks here please help, I haven't figured out a workaround for a 403 error
            on an embedded Google Drive folder).  I love exploring new recipes
            from around the world and would love to cook with someone.  I also love
            to craft, mostly origami and crochet, though I also do some photography,
            sketching, beading, and sewing.
        </p>
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>Since the age of eight, I've been obtaining grants and working on
            original research projects exploring a wide variety of topics.
            My research projects include:  Exploring the effects of
            diet on microvascular inflammation (independent project; mouse
            models approved by Cornell University IRB), how compost percentages
            and types affect plant growth to form an optimal growth mixture for
            watershed protection (SoilNow Lab, Cornell University), and how
            enrichment changes mouse vocalizations and social interactions
            (Tschida Lab, Cornell University).  I've also written a research
            review (currently unpublished) about the negative symptoms of
            schizophrenia and recent advances in medication options for
            their treatment (Tompkins Cortland Community College).
        </p>
        <h3>My other hobbies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Studying (yes, I do consider this a hobby)</li>
            <li>Playing music (violin and voice)</li>
            <li>Listening to heavy metal</li>
            <li>Coding and web design</li>
            <li>Discussing philosophy and/or politics</li>
            <li>Tutoring</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>More on tutoring</h3>
        <p>In my hometown, I used to do a lot of tutoring, and to be honest, I
            miss it so much.  I tutored English, Spanish, math (from prealgebra to
            calculus I), and science (earth science, biology, chemistry, physics).
            I usually think through problems in a different way, and often a
            different perspective is all you need to understand a difficult concept.
            If you're interested of know someone who would benefit, please DM me!

        <h3>My plans for the future</h3>
        <p>Well, number one plan on this list has to be to get better at my French ...
            I'm hoping to transfer into the Neuroscience program at McGill and perform
            original research projects, then hopefully get into graduate school and
            eventually into the field doing research in neuroscience.
