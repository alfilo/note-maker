        <h1>What's in the notes?</h1>
        <p>These are notes from courses I've taken at three different colleges:
            McGill University, Cayuga Community College, and Tompkins Cortland
            Community College. The way that I use them is as a group study tool,
            so that you can study with someone who hasn't yet taken the course.
            They are comprehensive and long, but they contain all the necessary
            information to succeed in tests.  Some of these notes are not fully
            complete (for example, if I'm currently taking that course), but the
            notes from TC3 and CCC are completed.
